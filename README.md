# Create a Gantt chart with vanilla JavaScript

This is the code repository to accompany the tutorial on how to **Create a Gantt chart with vanilla JavaScript** available at [bryntum.com/blog/creating-a-gantt-chart-with-vanilla-javascript](https://www.bryntum.com/blog/creating-a-gantt-chart-with-vanilla-javascript).

You can use this to build your own custom Gantt chart component.

Alternatively, if youâ€™re instead looking to buy an off-the-shelf battle-tested solution that just works, take a look at some examples of our [Bryntum Gantt Chart](https://www.bryntum.com/products/gantt/).
